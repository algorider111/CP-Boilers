Let’s now make a **complete, detailed, book-style explanation** of the **Euclidean Algorithm for GCD**, written in **easy English** but with full **mathematical clarity and proof**.
We’ll start from the definition → intuition → algorithm → proof → complexity → worst case → code → applications.

# 📘 The Euclidean Algorithm for Computing the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

---

## 🔹 1. Definition of GCD

Given two **non-negative integers** (a) and (b), their **greatest common divisor (GCD)** is the **largest positive integer** that divides both (a) and (b) without leaving a remainder.

We denote it as:
[
\gcd(a, b)
]

Formally:
[
\gcd(a, b) = \max {k > 0 \mid k \mid a \text{ and } k \mid b }
]
where the symbol “(|)” means *divides*.

---

### 🧩 Example

* (\gcd(12, 18) = 6)
  (divisors of 12 → {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}; divisors of 18 → {1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18}; largest common is 6)

* (\gcd(15, 10) = 5)

* (\gcd(9, 28) = 1) (they are **co-prime**)

---

### ⚠️ Special Cases

1. (\gcd(a, 0) = a)
   because any number divides 0.
2. (\gcd(0, b) = b)
3. (\gcd(0, 0)) is **undefined**, but we often **define it as 0** to keep formulas consistent.

---

## 🔹 2. The Basic Idea — Euclid’s Observation

More than 2000 years ago, **Euclid** observed an amazing property:

> The GCD of two numbers does **not change** if you replace the larger number by its **difference** with the smaller number.

Mathematically:
[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(a - b, b)
]
for (a > b).

---

### ✅ Example:

Let’s find (\gcd(18, 12)):

| Step | a  | b  | a − b | New pair |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | -------- |
| 1    | 18 | 12 | 6     | (12, 6)  |
| 2    | 12 | 6  | 6     | (6, 6)   |
| 3    | 6  | 6  | 0     | (6, 0)   |

→ GCD = 6

---

### 🧠 Why does this work?

Suppose (g) divides both (a) and (b).
Then (g) also divides their difference (a - b).

Because:
[
a = b + (a - b)
]
So if (g \mid b) and (g \mid (a - b)), then (g \mid a).

Thus, the **set of common divisors** of ((a, b)) and ((b, a - b)) are the **same**.
Hence, their GCDs are equal.

---

## 🔹 3. Optimized Form — Using Modulo

Subtracting repeatedly is slow.
Instead, we can **jump directly** by using modulo (`%`).

We know:
[
a \bmod b = a - \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor \times b
]

Hence we can directly reduce:
[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \bmod b)
]

and stop when (b = 0).

---

### 📘 Algorithm Definition

[
\gcd(a, b) =
\begin{cases}
a, & \text{if } b = 0 \
\gcd(b, a \bmod b), & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
]

---

## 🔹 4. Step-by-Step Example

Let’s compute (\gcd(48, 18)):

| Step | a  | b  | a % b | New (a, b) |
| ---- | -- | -- | ----- | ---------- |
| 1    | 48 | 18 | 12    | (18, 12)   |
| 2    | 18 | 12 | 6     | (12, 6)    |
| 3    | 12 | 6  | 0     | (6, 0)     |

👉 Stop when b = 0 → **GCD = 6**

---

## 🔹 5. Mathematical Proof that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)

Let (a = qb + r) where (r = a \bmod b).

We need to show:
[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)
]

---

### (i) If (d) divides both (a) and (b)

Then (d) also divides:
[
a - qb = r
]
So (d) divides (r).

Hence, any common divisor of (a) and (b) also divides (b) and (r).

---

### (ii) If (d) divides both (b) and (r)

Then (d) divides:
[
a = qb + r
]
So (d) divides (a).

Hence, any common divisor of (b) and (r) also divides (a) and (b).

---

✅ Therefore, the sets of common divisors of ((a, b)) and ((b, r)) are identical.
So:
[
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, r)
]

---

## 🔹 6. Implementation in C++

### Recursive

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b ? gcd(b, a % b) : a;
}
```

### Iterative (non-recursive)

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    while (b) {
        a %= b;
        swap(a, b);
    }
    return a;
}
```

Both versions work efficiently for all positive integers.

✅ Since C++17, you can directly use:

```cpp
#include <numeric>
int g = std::gcd(a, b);
```

---

## 🔹 7. Time Complexity — Why O(log(min(a, b)))?

Each recursive step reduces the numbers **very fast**.

When we replace (a) by (a \bmod b), the new number becomes **strictly smaller than b**.
So the numbers shrink quickly, roughly by a factor of ≥2 each time.

---

### ⚙️ Formal Analysis (Lamé’s Theorem)

**Lamé’s Theorem** states:
If (a > b ≥ 1) and (b < F_n) (where (F_n) is the n-th Fibonacci number),
then the Euclidean algorithm performs **at most (n − 2)** recursive calls.

Because Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially:
[
F_n \approx \frac{\phi^n}{\sqrt{5}} \quad \text{where } \phi ≈ 1.618
]
so (n ≈ O(\log b)).

Hence:
[
\text{Time Complexity} = O(\log(\min(a, b)))
]

---

### 🧨 Worst Case

The **worst case** happens when the inputs are **consecutive Fibonacci numbers**.

Example:
[
a = F_7 = 13,\quad b = F_6 = 8
]

| Step | a  | b | a % b |
| ---- | -- | - | ----- |
| 1    | 13 | 8 | 5     |
| 2    | 8  | 5 | 3     |
| 3    | 5  | 3 | 2     |
| 4    | 3  | 2 | 1     |
| 5    | 2  | 1 | 0     |

→ 5 steps = (n - 2), exactly as the theorem predicts.

So, **Fibonacci pairs** are the **slowest** possible case.

---

## 🔹 8. GCD of More Than Two Numbers

GCD is **associative**, meaning:
[
\gcd(a, b, c) = \gcd(a, \gcd(b, c))
]

So we can compute it pairwise.

Example:

```cpp
int g = gcd(a, gcd(b, c));
```

---

## 🔹 9. Least Common Multiple (LCM)

GCD helps in finding LCM easily using the relation:
[
\text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\gcd(a, b)}
]

To avoid overflow, divide first:

```cpp
int lcm(int a, int b) {
    return a / gcd(a, b) * b;
}
```

Both `GCD` and `LCM` run in **O(log(min(a, b)))**.

---

## 🔹 10. Binary GCD (Stein’s Algorithm)

Sometimes modulo (`%`) is slower than bitwise operations.
The **Binary GCD** algorithm replaces `%` with **bit shifts** and **subtractions**.

### Properties Used:

1. If both even:
   (\gcd(2a, 2b) = 2 \times \gcd(a, b))
2. If one even, one odd:
   Remove factor of 2 from even number.
3. If both odd:
   (\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(|a - b|, \min(a, b)))

### Implementation:

```cpp
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    if (!a || !b)
        return a | b;
    unsigned shift = __builtin_ctz(a | b); // count trailing zeros
    a >>= __builtin_ctz(a);
    do {
        b >>= __builtin_ctz(b);
        if (a > b) swap(a, b);
        b -= a;
    } while (b);
    return a << shift;
}
```

This method avoids division or modulo operations, using only **bit operations** — much faster on low-level systems.

## 🏁 Final Intuition Summary

* GCD **keeps removing remainders** until nothing remains.
* Each step reduces the numbers **fast** (roughly halves them).
* It’s one of the **oldest and most efficient** algorithms known (over 2300 years old!).
* Still forms the **foundation** of modern number theory and computational mathematics.
